  ""text"": ""Security is the most important attribute of a VPN.  A VPN's primary function is to protect user privacy and data by encrypting internet traffic and masking the user's IP address.  Therefore, robust security features such as strong encryption (like AES-256), secure protocols (like OpenVPN), and a lack of IP and DNS leaks are paramount.
