  ""text"": ""Based on the provided sources, several VPN brands are highlighted for their fast download speeds.  However, it's crucial to remember that VPN speed performance can vary significantly depending on factors like server location, server load, and your internet connection.  Therefore, \""best\"" is subjective and depends on individual needs and circumstances.\n\nSeveral sources specifically mention these VPNs as being fast, particularly for downloads:\n\n* **NordVPN:** Multiple sources (Sources [1], [2], [3], [4]) cite NordVPN as one of the fastest VPNs available, often emphasizing its speed and low speed loss.  Source [4] specifically claims it's the fastest, attributing this to its proprietary NordLynx protocol.\n\n* **Proton VPN:** Source [3] lists Proton VPN as the fastest for downloads. Source [5] also shows Proton VPN achieving high speeds in their testing, maxing out their test equipment.\n\n* **Surfshark:** Sources [1], [2], and [3] also include Surfshark among the fastest VPNs. Source [5] also shows Surfshark achieving maximum speeds in their testing.\n\n\nOther VPNs mentioned for speed, though not explicitly for downloads, include:\n\n* **Private Internet Access:** Listed in Source [3] as the fastest for streaming and gaming, which often implies good download speeds.\n\n* **IPVanish:** Source [3] suggests IPVanish is fastest for smartphones.\n\n* **Mullvad:** Source [5] shows Mullvad achieving maximum speeds in their testing.\n\n* **Windscribe:** Source [5] shows Windscribe achieving maximum speeds in their testing.\n\n\n**In summary:** While NordVPN and Proton VPN are frequently cited as the fastest for downloads, Surfshark, Mullvad, and Windscribe also demonstrate high speeds.  The best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and priorities.  It's recommended to try out a few different services if possible, as individual experiences can vary.  Keep in mind that speed test results may differ depending on the methodology and testing environment."",
