gemini-1.5-flash-grounded,"{""Response"": ""Determining the single \""best\"" VPN for speed is difficult because speed tests and rankings vary depending on the testing methodology, server location, time of day, and individual internet connection.  However, based on the provided sources from January and September/October 2024 and January 2025,  Surfshark and NordVPN consistently rank among the fastest.\n\n**Top contenders from the sources:**\n\n* **Surfshark:** Multiple sources (Tom's Guide, TechRadar) reported Surfshark as the fastest VPN tested, often maxing out their testing speeds (over 950 Mbps download).  Its consistently high scores across various reviews point to its strong performance.\n\n* **NordVPN:**  Frequently cited as a top performer, NordVPN utilizes its proprietary NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard) to optimize speed. While some sources placed it slightly behind Surfshark, its speed is still considered exceptional.  Its average speed loss is reported to be around 10%,  maintaining a high percentage of the original internet speed.\n\n**Other fast VPNs mentioned:**\n\n* **Mullvad:**  Achieved very high speeds in some tests, but its smaller server network might lead to occasional congestion.\n\n* **ProtonVPN:** Consistently shows good speed performance.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Testing Methodology:** Remember that speed test results can vary significantly depending on the testing methods used.\n\n* **Server Location:**  Your connection speed will be impacted by the distance between your device and the VPN server. Choosing a server geographically closer will generally improve speeds.\n\n* **Server Load:**  The number of users connected to a specific VPN server at a given time affects speeds.  During peak usage, speeds might be slower.\n\n* **Protocol:**  The VPN protocol used also matters. WireGuard is often associated with faster speeds compared to older protocols like OpenVPN.  NordLynx and other proprietary protocols aim to further optimize WireGuard's performance.\n\n* **Your Internet Connection:** Your own internet connection's speed is a limiting factor. A VPN cannot make your internet faster than it already is.\n\nIn conclusion, while Surfshark frequently tops speed tests, NordVPN remains a strong contender.  The best VPN for *you* will depend on your specific needs and priorities beyond just speed, such as security features, privacy policies, and price.  It's recommended to check recent independent reviews and consider conducting your own speed tests with different VPN services to determine which one best suits your circumstances."", ""RetrievalScore"": 0.0, ""URLs"": ""https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUBnsYsLrH74RUOEk4kapqXv52mVHB87iXKMzG_2heAsoc2VPNxD4AehNSRgX-Nct_6FvC-E-UYQmqO3f-wTzurVR49RqLPkThBXL8Padq28IOjoYuGUxmnR0GboFyI9h4d8aQ6yVN048Dc=; https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUBnsYv--QDl0KXfDKgkaK6i5xn1HIUa7gIX1DxyOSgsp0HCN-qgsmg6xtvpsSuaVqkzUbkI709fLS6esvQ9eSMU2MYhw_Ys4NKc_Csab5LkK1Bmf3pPla05oQLs4OdzB9JkHPDdnTeFFbJcd4q7_rf_k5Kd8r1mN3AsOsAIU0xtgrliw2gpne-nLpD8wmsE2OgdpLG7Vw3EGjQyehfnTiwCoZvVvCSc; https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUBnsYsw84mk3H-hnROOXAd4dtH26ru10b353kfAMPZVcYxgxzwp8SSEh3L_TLifxQBp-pZhU7WVkjHGYzsVbJPixACoLeoZK_suK5wm1FwjZVFrgVF3GyTQHXEaFVz72oHdQhU2Y3kXEyckheEDogOeVTw1I85s3vSEqtrWahZNGGRFhf1lYzaq6t0=; https://www.techradar.com/vpn/fastest-vpn; https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-fast-vpn""}"
